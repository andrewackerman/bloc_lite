A library aimed at making it simple to use the BLoC design pattern to separate the presentation code from the business logic and the state.

## Overview

The goal of this library is to make it as easy as possible to implement the [BLoC design pattern](https://www.didierboelens.com/2018/08/reactive-programming---streams---bloc) with a bare minimum amount of complexity and boilerplate. It also tries to remain as design and implementation-agnostic as possible so developers can represent their business logic and state however they want.

## Examples

 - [Counter (Simple)](https://github.com/andrewackerman/simple_bloc/tree/master/examples/simple_flutter_counter)
 - [Counter With State](https://github.com/andrewackerman/simple_bloc/tree/master/examples/simple_flutter_counter_with_state)
 - [Counter With InheritedBloc](https://github.com/andrewackerman/simple_bloc/tree/master/examples/simple_flutter_counter_with_inheritence)
 - [Counter With InheritedBlocTree](https://github.com/andrewackerman/simple_bloc/tree/master/examples/simple_flutter_with_tree)
