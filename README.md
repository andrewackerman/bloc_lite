## Overview

The goal of this library is to make it as easy as possible to implement the [BLoC design pattern](https://www.didierboelens.com/2018/08/reactive-programming---streams---bloc) with a bare minimum amount of complexity and boilerplate. It also tries to remain as design and implementation-agnostic as possible so developers can represent their business logic and state however they want.
